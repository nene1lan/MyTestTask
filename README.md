This application allows you to use the CYBT-353027 board via a Graphic User Interface (GUI).

You can:
  Connect to a COM port from the list;
  Update the COM port list (useful if you forgot to connect the device before launching the application);
  Send the Reset command;
  Send the Read Address command;
  Send the Write Address command (thereâ€™s a field next to the Write Address button for the address);
  Read the Output.
  
Below is an example of how the program functions.
